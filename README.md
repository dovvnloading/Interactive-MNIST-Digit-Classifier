# Interactive-MNIST-Digit-Classifier

MNIST Digit Classifier & Drawer is a versatile application designed to engage users in the world of machine 
learning and neural networks. Built around a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset, 
the app allows users to draw handwritten digits directly onto a canvas interface. Upon completion, 
the model instantly predicts the drawn digit with high accuracy. This interactive experience not only showcases 
the capabilities of modern AI technology but also serves as an educational tool for understanding image 
classification and neural network operations. Whether for educational purposes or fun experimentation, 
MNIST Digit Classifier & Drawer provides an intuitive and insightful glimpse into the workings of machine learning.

*** I've included a trained model. To use it - simply place the file in the same location as your script. 
The Mnist dataset will automatically download to a folder within the script location. This will only occur once, 
unless the dataset is moved.

# Structuring 

1. Import Statements
Purpose: Imports necessary libraries and modules for machine learning (TensorFlow, Keras), data handling (NumPy),
plotting (Matplotlib), user interface (Tkinter), file system operations (os), and image manipulation (scipy.ndimage.zoom).
Modules Used:
TensorFlow and Keras: For building and training neural networks.
NumPy: For numerical operations on data arrays.
Matplotlib: For plotting graphs and images.
Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
os: For file operations, like checking if a file exists.
scipy.ndimage.zoom: For resizing images (used for the drawing canvas).

3. load_and_preprocess_data Function
Purpose: Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset.
Steps:
Loads the MNIST dataset using mnist.load_data().
Normalizes pixel values to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.
Reshapes the data to fit the Conv2D input shape (28x28 pixels, 1 channel).
Converts labels to categorical format using to_categorical.

11. predict_digit Function
Purpose: Predicts the digit from a given image sample using the trained model.
Input: Takes a single image sample reshaped to (28, 28, 1).
Output: Returns the predicted digit as a numerical value.
__________________________________________________________
13. DrawingClassifier Class
Purpose: Implements an interactive interface for drawing digits and predicting them using the trained model.
Components:
Initialization: Sets up Matplotlib figures for drawing and prediction display, creates a Tkinter window for UI controls.

15. launch_menu Function
Purpose: Provides a graphical menu interface to either start training a new model or run a test using a saved model.
Buttons: Creates buttons in a Tkinter window for 'Run Test' and 'Start Training'.
Functionality:
Run Test: Loads a saved model and runs the DrawingClassifier interface for interactive testing.
Start Training: Loads data, creates a new model, trains it, evaluates on test data, saves the model,
and then runs the DrawingClassifier interface.
